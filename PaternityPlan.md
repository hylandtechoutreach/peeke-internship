# Joseph's Plan for Paternity Leave: July
My main responsibility for this summer is the PEEKE internship project. Therefore, all of this planning will be related to that project.

## Before I Go
If possible, I would like to take a look at the [Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/hto-projects/projects/2/views/1?filterQuery=Backlog) of issues one last time before my departure. It is my plan to regularly update the Backlog so that whenever I happen to leave, it will be in a decent two-weeks-out state.

In addition, I am also planning to establish some recurring meetings. I would like to schedule some of these meetings before I go, so when someone else leads them while I'm gone, they will have that point of reference.

I will also setup automated replies for my e-mail.

## Meetings
There are a few different types of meetings I think will be relevant to the software development process. Establishing this structure will help the interns stay focused and productive while I am gone.

### Stand-ups
These daily meetings should be quick check-ins with the interns. They should each say:

- What they worked on yesterday/last week
- What they will work on today
- Any roadblocks they are facing

### Playtesting
One person should host the game from a big shared screen, and everybody else should join as a player. Everybody should play the game, and consider the experience. After playtesting, any piece of pertinent feedback should be made into a GitHub issue.

### Sprint Planning / Backlog Refinement
The goal of these meetings will be to figure out what everybody will do for the next two weeks. It should start with the **Backlog** column; issues should be prioritized, added, removed, and considered. Each intern should be assigned a number of issues that should hopefully take them two weeks to complete. Those issues should be moved into the **Todo** column.

### UX Review
This meeting will consider all aspects of the user experience for the game. The game should be tested in a similar way to Playtesting, but with more of an emphasis on aesthetics and usability. Issues should be created for any feedback.

### Midsummer Demo
Interns should use this time to practice demonstrating the software. They should be able to present their work to some group of stakeholders, and show off what they've accomplished. The main focus should be on the product itself, and the "stakeholders" (who could be anyone) should get a chance to see the game in action.

### Final Presentation
As a group, the interns should do a final presentation about their project. The presentation should include:

- Background about each intern
- Brief discussion of the product architecture
- Rundown of each intern's contributions to the project
- Lessons learned along the way
- A demonstration of the software

Each intern should be responsible for leading one part of the presentation.

## Additional Considerations
If the interns find that they have run out of work to do, here are some additional avenues they can venture down:

- Marketing for the game
- Scalability
- Deployment to AWS
- Monetization
- Other potential games using the platform
- Streaming potential (like on Twitch)

## Delegation
It will be helpful for my responsibilities to be split up among multiple people.

- Answering e-mails: Caitlin
- Leading stand-up meetings: Caitlin
- Being in-office: Caitlin, Shayne
- Answering code questions: Anyone on Discord
- Conducting code reviews: Intern team, Lucas, Shayne
- Lead other meetings: Emi

## Conclusion
I sincerely appreciate your help in making this internship program a success! It has already been an incredibly valuable experience for these young students, and I know you will be able to make it even better. Thank you!
