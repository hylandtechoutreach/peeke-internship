# Basic Rundown
Here is a basic rundown of the internship.

## Scheduling
There will be some important meetings to attend, either in-person or on Zoom. There will also be a lot of time spent working (aka "homework") that will not require any specific timing.

## Intern Expectations
There are some basic expectations we hope all interns will be able to meet.

- Attend all scheduled Zoom meetings or in-person meetings for your group
  - Please let us know if you have a conflict!
- Participate actively during group activities
- Complete any assigned "homework" independently
- Communicate professionally
  - Check your e-mail
  - Check Discord
  - Do not say anything inappropriate
- Reach out and ask for help if you need it
  - Let us know how you're feeling!

## Hours
Interns will be ultimately responsible for keeping track of their own hours, but the Tech Outreach team will need to verify them.

- Some of your hours will be "direct" - time spent in meetings with us
- Some of your hours will be "homework" that we expect you to complete on your own time
- You may also have "self-driven" hours - if you want to work more, do more research, learn more, etc
